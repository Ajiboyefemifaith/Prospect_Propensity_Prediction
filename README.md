# Overview
Propensity prediction is a valuable tool for businesses as it enables them to identify the prospects who are most likely to convert into paying customers. By targeting these high-propensity prospects with tailored marketing campaigns, businesses can increase their conversion rates, reduce acquisition costs, and ultimately, boost revenue.
In this project, we'll use machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a prospect taking a particular action. This is known as propensity prediction, and it's an essential technique for businesses that are looking to optimize their marketing efforts and boost their bottom line.
